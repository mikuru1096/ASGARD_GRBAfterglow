Done: frequencies Vobs should passed in from outside the fortran code.
Done: gamma-gamma annihilation should be calculated with the spectra both of SYN and SSC.
 So it should be calculated after the SYN and SSC codes, and called as a module in python codes.
Done: EBL code should be callable as a module in python codes, and it should be wrote with a interpolation algorithm.
TODO: The code of sensitivities of different detectors should be callable as a module in python codes.
 It should has two parts, time-dependent and energy dependent.
TODO: The results must be output as $LATEX$ and PDF files.
TODO: The electron spectrum part has implemented with openmp, but the acceleration efficiency may be low. 
 It is due to that the implementation of acceleration is deep inside the DO LOOP, i.e., under the DO LOOP of sheel radius,
 which means the operations per thread is compressed.
